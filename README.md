# CS330 - 3D Scene Development 

# How I Approach Designing Software
When designing software, I focus on modularity, clarity, and functional best practices. For this project, I approached the 3D scene design by organizing the code into reusable, well-defined helper functions like SetTransformations(), SetShaderTexture(), and SetShaderMaterial(). Each function served a specific role, reducing duplication and promoting easier maintenance. By following single-responsibility principles, I made the codebase scalable, readable, and easy to debug.

# New Design Skills Crafted 
This project helped me develop stronger skills in modular function design, texture mapping, material configuration, and lighting techniques. I learned how to build a 3D environment by combining different shapes and textures logically, creating a natural and structured landscape that closely matched a 2D reference image.

# Future Application of Design Tactics
The modular coding tactics and emphasis on clear, documented functions can be applied in future 3D projects, game development, or UI design. Breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts will help me scale future software efficiently while maintaining readability and adaptability.

# How I Approach Developing Programs 
I approach development by building a strong foundation with modular utility functions first. I develop helper methods early so that creating, transforming, and rendering new objects becomes easy and consistent. I rely heavily on writing reusable and well-commented code blocks to minimize redundancy and make adjustments quickly as project needs evolve.

# New Development Strategies Used 
In this project, I implemented reusable transformation and material setup functions that could be parameterized for different objects. I also used efficient texture-loading strategies (CreateGLTexture()) and employed lighting techniques that considered ambient, diffuse, and specular balances to enhance realism without sacrificing performance.

# Role of Iteration in Development
Iteration played a major role throughout development. I regularly tested lighting settings, material shininess, texture tiling, and camera controls to refine the visual experience. Through repeated testing and adjustment, I improved lighting realism, ensured smooth camera navigation, and corrected issues like overexposure or flattening caused by incorrect ambient light settings.

# How My Development Evolved 
At the beginning of the milestones, my focus was mainly on getting basic rendering working. As the project progressed, my skills evolved toward creating a more immersive and polished scene. I shifted from simple functionality to optimizing lighting quality, combining primitives creatively, and ensuring that camera controls enhanced user interaction.

# How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals
Computer science gives me the tools to design and build real-world systems that solve problems creatively and efficiently. Skills in computational graphics and software design expand my technical toolkit, preparing me for future roles in software engineering and UI/UX development

# How Computational Graphics and Visualization Support My Educational and Professional Pathways 

Working on computational graphics deepened my understanding of 3D object creation, lighting models, texture mapping, and scene navigation, all of which are essential for careers in game development, VR/AR systems, and visual data analysis. Educationally, it solidified core programming skills and algorithmic thinking. Professionally, it enhanced my ability to build interactive visual experiences, making me more versatile and competitive in the tech industry.
